Contextual Advertising
======================

Pay-per-click advertising is changing rapidly. New technology helps us better target ads at more and more specific subsections of consumers. The old style pay-per-click is practically obsolete, since tools utilizing new mediums and new targeting capabilities can help you find your exact consumer. Instead of focusing entirely on pay-per-click, the range has expanded to include contextual advertising, online video, and highly-targeted product ads.

For instance, it’s now possible to target people who watch certain television shows in certain geographical areas. It’s possible to target ads to exact age ranges, favorite clothing brands, and even target based on Facebook relationship status. There’s now a wealth of information consumers are self-supplying on the Internet, and this information can help you to pinpoint with more specificity and offer a more tailored advertising experience for your market.
