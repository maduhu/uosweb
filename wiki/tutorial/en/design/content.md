User-Centric Content
====================


For years, SEO copywriting has been a large part of web design and promotion. But Google’s changing search algorithms have made it increasingly hard to keep up with the new SEO guidelines. Keyword stuffing and focusing copy from a keyword perspective is the wrong approach to modern SEO, and will only get you penalized under the new guidelines.

It’s time to say goodbye to SEO copywriting and start developing keyword informed and user-centric content instead. Just like in marketing 101, you need to develop easily understood copy with which your target market will emotionally connect. It’s also important to keep your content on message and use copywriting to build up your brand, instead of focusing on SEO exclusively. Essentially, when it comes to copywriting, you should be embracing a back-to-basics approach.
