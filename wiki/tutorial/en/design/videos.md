Video / moving backgrounds
==========================

Why read about it when you can watch it? Something else you will start seeing all over the Web (especially in hero areas) are videos. Even Coin, the popular new device, is even utilizing a video in its hero area (see above).

Videos are becoming easier to produce, and easier to share not on your website, but on social media as well. While some may argue that videos don’t belong on a website home page due to the large amount of data they take to load and run (especially on mobile devices and internet with data caps), videos are an effective way to communicate something technical or new when words just don’t cut it.

Plus, many video services such as YouTube allow you to track how many views it got, allowing you to better plan your content for your website.

This is definitely something I think we'll be seeing a lot more of. The Guardian's 'Firestorm' provides a good example, and I reckon more brands - rather than content sites - will make the most of dynamic backgrounds in 2014.
