Fonts with personality
======================

“Fonts with personality” are fonts that feel like they can stand on their own. They are not your standard serif or san-serif font (ahem, Helvetica). Designers are starting to find different fonts to add to their arsenal that add a little personality and uniqueness to their designs.

For instance, check out Stuff and Nonsense’s new website design above. They could have used any old serif font, but they picked a beautiful serif font that keeps it professional but with a side of personality. We expect to see many more websites in 2014 getting away from very simple and overused typefaces and finding some with personality.

# Varied typography

Web fonts are on the rise, designers are favouring bigger font sizes than ever, and mix and match is proving to be very popular. In addition, responsive typography should become a bigger part of responsive web design.
