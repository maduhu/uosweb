Visual Storytelling
===================

As visual media increases in importance all over the Internet, there has been an unsurprising decrease in text-heavy websites. Instead of telling your story in a paragraph or block of text, the trend now is to invest in more visual storytelling. Text has been cut down to the essentials, while visuals are increasingly employed to impart important information.

This isn’t only true for the design of websites. The increasing reliance on visuals has also crept into the biggest social media spheres. With the rapid rise of visual-focused social channel Pinterest, Facebook and Twitter have both taken steps to increase the prominence and integration of visual media into their platforms.

For sites more text-based by nature, there is a trend towards richer content experiences — text integrated with pictures, video, and interactive functionality. Now, websites are better integrating text with visual components to give users a more immersive and interactive experience. Combining content and visuals to tell a story can help hold the attention of even the Internet’s most impatient users.
