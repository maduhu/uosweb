Either it be a simple blurred photo in the background with a heading centered in the middle, hero areas are quickly replacing sliders as the new attention-grabbers, and they are becoming increasingly creative and elaborate.

Integration with social media, asking for email subscriptions, long scrolling sites, and fast loading sites all help make the mobile Web a more friendlier place.

Videos are becoming easier to produce, and easier to share not on your website, but on social media as well.

“Fonts with personality” are fonts that feel like they can stand on their own. They are not your standard serif or san-serif font (ahem, Helvetica). Designers are starting to find different fonts to add to their arsenal that add a little personality and uniqueness to their designs.

With the release of iOS7 came the design aesthetic most commonly known as “flat design.” While dropping drop shadows and gradients often seems like a good idea in some cases to give a more updated look to things, Apple took it to a whole other level by dropping pretty much any design element it could.
