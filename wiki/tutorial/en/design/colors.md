Simple color schemes
====================

And by simple, we mean really only one or two colors. The use of a more simple color scheme seems to come with flat design, but not always. Use a color predominately throughout the design, but not the only color you see.

In design and art, white and black aren’t considered colors, but neutrals. White, black, and everything in between are popular color schemes now, and adding just a hit of another color, such as red, adds drama and impact – all things that garnish attention when used in the right way.
