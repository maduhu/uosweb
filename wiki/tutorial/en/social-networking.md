## General Contact Guidelines
For most of our integration partners, we don't have a direct truly "technical" contact. We do have partner manager contacts through which we proxy our technical requests. Often the conversation with these partner managers is aided greatly by giving them details on the customer impact data. The Business Development group either proxies the requests or is copied on all correspondence.
The first step for all of these partners is going to be filing a bug or submitting a ticket through the issue tracker for that system. After that has been done, we may ask our contacts for assistance when the issue is a high priority issue or just hasn't gotten any attention. If the issue is truely urgent (P1 and some P2 issues), we will often loop our contacts in as soon as the bug or issue has been filed.
